# MineSweeper v1.1


This project is a mimic game of the original WindowsXP game minesweeper.

I try to copy all the functions that the old game had, and if possible, make some more functions to make it better.

## Components

Now there's Three Python Scripts in the workspace:

The [BasicRule.py][1] uses basic Python Object Oriented to establish the rules and logic of the game. It's the basic file of the whole project.

The [window.py][2] uses the module PySide2 to create the GUI for the players.

The [main.py][3] is a start program of the game.

Besides, there's another python file [image.py][4]. It contains the photos' data used in the file [window.py][2].

## Run Of the Game

Clicked all the blanks where there's no mine hidden. And the blanks clicked shows the number of the mines besides it.

- Click LeftButton to clear the mine.
- Click RightButton to place a flag which marks the position of the mine.
- Click LeftButton and RightButton together to click all blanks around together. But it cannot work when the flags placed around is not equal to the mines surrounding.

## Collaborators Wanted

The GUI still needs to be improved. Wanted someone good at game UI design to help me.

There are still some functions needing adding, such as the rank and so on.

If you are interested, just join me.

The Photos used are in the directory, too. If you are the author of some photo, you can email me to ask for the pay.
