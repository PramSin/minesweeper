# MineSweeper

This project is a mimic game of the original WindowsXP game minesweeper.

I try to copy all the functions that the old game had, and if possible, make some more functions to make it better.

Now there's Three Python Scripts in the workspace:

The [BasicRule.py][1] uses basic Python Object Oriented to establish the rules and logic of the game. It's the basic file of the whole project.

The [window.py][2] uses the module PyQt5 to create the GUI for the players.

The [扫雷.py][3] is a start program of the game.

Besides, there's another python file [image.py][4]. It contains the photos' data used in the file [window.py][2].

The GUI still needs to be improved. Wanted someone good at game UI design to help me.

There're still some functions need adding, such as the rank and so on.

If you are interested, just join me.

The Photos used are in the directory, too. If you are the author of some photo, you can email me to ask for the pay.
